.
.SH "NAME"
\fBsocketmaster\fR \- Zero downtime restart for your apps
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsocketmaster\fR [\-listen=URI] [\-command=PATH] [\-start=MILLIS] [\-syslog]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
socketmaster is a generic solution to the restart problem: you want to restart your app but neither lose any active connection nor refuse new connections\.
.
.P
socketmaster opens the socket you want to listen on and passes it onto your program\. Because socketmaster is simple enough it doesn\'t need to be restarted and can keep your file\-descriptor indefinitely open\.
.
.TP
\fB\-command\fR=PATH
Defines the location of the program to execute and pass the file\-descriptor onto\. If you need to add arguments to the program, use \-\- before the command specific arguments or use a wrapper script\.
.
.IP
e\.g\. socketmaster \-command \fIcommand\fR \-\- \-arg1 \-arg2
.
.TP
\fB\-listen\fR=URI
One of the following schemes are accepted: tcp, tcp4, tcp6 and unix\. Example: tcp4://localhost:8945 or unix:///tmp/myapp\.sock
.
.TP
\fB\-start\fR=MILLIS
Determines how long socketmaster waits before signaling the old process\. If MILLIS is set to zero that feature is disabled\.
.
.TP
\fB\-syslog\fR
Tells socketmaster to log to syslog\.
.
.TP
\fB\-user\fR=LOGIN
Sets the child process\'s uid/gid to the given user (looked up in /etc/passwd)\. This command only works when socketmaster is run as root\.
.
.SH "HOW IT WORKS"
On start:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
socketmaster open the \-listen port
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
socketmaster starts the \-command with the socket on fd 3 and EINHORN_FDS=3
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
as soon as all child processes are gone, socketmaster stops as well
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
On SIGHUP:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
socketmaster starts a new \-command
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
waits for \-start milliseconds
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
sends a SIGTERM to the other child processes
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Your server is responsible for:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
opening the socket passed on fd 3
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
not crashing
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
gracefully shutdown on SIGTERM (close the listener, wait for the child connections to close)
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
\fBEINHORN_FDS\fR
This variable is set by socketmaster and passed onto the children\. Its value is always 3 and meant for einhorn compatibility\.
.
.SH "SIGNALS"
On SIGHUP, socketmaster starts a new child process, waits for \-start and sends a HUP to the old process\.
.
.P
SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGQUIT are forwarded to the child processes\.
