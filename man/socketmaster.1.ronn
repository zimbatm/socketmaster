socketmaster(1) -- Zero downtime restart for your apps
======================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`socketmaster` [-listen=URI] [-command=PATH] [-start=MILLIS] [-syslog]

## DESCRIPTION

socketmaster is a generic solution to the restart problem ; you want to restart
your app but not loose any active connection nor refuse new connections.

socketmaster opens the socket you want to listen on and passes it onto your
program. Because socketmaster is simple enough is doesn't need to be restarted
and can keep your file-descriptor indefinitely open.

  * `-command`=PATH:
    Defines the location of the program to execute and pass the file-descriptor
    onto. If you need to add arguments to the program use a wrapper script.
  
  * `-listen`=URI:
    One of the following schemes are accepted: tcp, tcp4, tcp6 and unix.
    Example: tcp4://localhost:8945 or unix:///tmp/myapp.sock

  * `-start`=MILLIS:
    Determines how long socketmaster waits before signaling the old process.
    If MILLIS is set to zero that feature is disabled.

  * `-syslog`:
    Tells socketmaster to log to syslog.

  * `-user`=LOGIN:
    Sets the child process's uid/gid to the given user (looked up in /etc/passwd).
    This command only works when socketmaster is run as root.

## HOW IT WORKS

On start:

 * socketmaster open the -listen port
 * socketmaster starts the -command with the socket on fd 3 and EINHORN_FDS=3
 * as soon as all child processes are gone, socketmaster stops as well

On SIGHUP:

 * socketmaster starts a new -command
 * waits for -start milliseconds
 * sends a SIGHUP to the other child processes

Your server is responsible for:

 * open the socket passed on fd 3
 * not crashing
 * gracefully shutdown on SIGHUP (close the listener, wait for the child
   connections to close)

## ENVIRONMENT

  * `EINHORN_FDS`:
    This variable is set by socketmaster and passed onto the childs. It's
    value is always 3 and meant for einhorn compatiblity.

## SIGNALS

On SIGHUP, socketmaster starts a new child process, waits for -start and sends a
HUP to the old process.

SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGQUIT are forwarded to the child processes.

    a wider feature-set and written in ruby.
